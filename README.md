## To-Do-List App

This is a project created in React. It's intended purpose is to allow you to note tasks that you need to do. 

When you open a page, you should see an app as below:

![An example of app page](TDL1.jpg?raw=true "page example")

### How to use?

You use the app by providing input and pressing buttons. You can add new tasks, delete previous ones, move them up and move them down. 

The App currently DOES NOT remember state of the inputs, so you will lose all of them when reloading.
